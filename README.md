## Overview

ClearVote leverages 4 smart contracts built with Clarity to create a decentralized, transparent, and immutable system for managing elections, addressing issues like voter fraud, lack of transparency, and disputed results:

1. **Voter Registry Contract** – Registers and authenticates voters with unique IDs and credentials.
2. **Ballot Contract** – Records and tallies votes securely for each election.
3. **Verification Contract** – Manages election integrity checks and third-party audits.
4. **Results Contract** – Publishes transparent and auditable election outcomes.
